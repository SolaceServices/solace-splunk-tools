6.2.1.  PRI

   The PRI part MUST have three, four, or five characters and will be
   bound with angle brackets as the first and last characters.  The PRI
   part starts with a leading "<" ('less-than' character, %d60),
   followed by a number, which is followed by a ">" ('greater-than'
   character, %d62).  The number contained within these angle brackets
   is known as the Priority value (PRIVAL) and represents both the
   Facility and Severity.  The Priority value consists of one, two, or
   three decimal integers (ABNF DIGITS) using values of %d48 (for "0")
   through %d57 (for "9").

   Facility and Severity values are not normative but often used.  They
   are described in the following tables for purely informational
   purposes.  Facility values MUST be in the range of 0 to 23 inclusive.

          Numerical             Facility
             Code

              0             kernel messages
              1             user-level messages
              2             mail system
              3             system daemons
              4             security/authorization messages
              5             messages generated internally by syslogd
              6             line printer subsystem
              7             network news subsystem
              8             UUCP subsystem
              9             clock daemon
             10             security/authorization messages
             11             FTP daemon
             12             NTP subsystem
             13             log audit
             14             log alert
             15             clock daemon (note 2)
             16             local use 0  (local0)
             17             local use 1  (local1)
             18             local use 2  (local2)
             19             local use 3  (local3)
             20             local use 4  (local4)
             21             local use 5  (local5)
             22             local use 6  (local6)
             23             local use 7  (local7)

              Table 1.  Syslog Message Facilities

   Each message Priority also has a decimal Severity level indicator.
   These are described in the following table along with their numerical
   values.  Severity values MUST be in the range of 0 to 7 inclusive.
           Numerical         Severity
             Code

              0       Emergency: system is unusable
              1       Alert: action must be taken immediately
              2       Critical: critical conditions
              3       Error: error conditions
              4       Warning: warning conditions
              5       Notice: normal but significant condition
              6       Informational: informational messages
              7       Debug: debug-level messages

              Table 2. Syslog Message Severities

   The Priority value is calculated by first multiplying the Facility
   number by 8 and then adding the numerical value of the Severity.  For
   example, a kernel message (Facility=0) with a Severity of Emergency
   (Severity=0) would have a Priority value of 0.  Also, a "local use 4"
   message (Facility=20) with a Severity of Notice (Severity=5) would
   have a Priority value of 165.  In the PRI of a syslog message, these
   values would be placed between the angle brackets as <0> and <165>
   respectively.  The only time a value of "0" follows the "<" is for
   the Priority value of "0".  Otherwise, leading "0"s MUST NOT be used.
